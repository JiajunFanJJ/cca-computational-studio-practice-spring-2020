# Computational & Studio Practice, Spring 2020

This studio-based class is intended to support students' self-directed interdisciplinary projects.

We will cover a few special topics, and offer a space for support and inspiration, but the point of this class is your project.

## Background

If you feel rusty about programming in general or p5.js specifically, start by taking a look at the [Khan Academy *Intro to Programming*](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) materials. Students have also found [Lauren McCarthy's *Getting Started with p5.js* book](https://cca.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42JgAfZbU5mhpymZmoNPTANNGQJrRtAsn4EhB3wMxMII2OU15WSQck8Fr_JVALaIioAtLQXQIKRCgaleVjEPA0tJUWkqL4TiZpBwcw1x9tAFWhwPHeCIN7O0MALdKIlTCgBKEyal) useful, along with [Daniel Shiffman's *Coding Train* videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
